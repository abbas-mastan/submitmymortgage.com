                <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">We may use your personal information to provide and improve our services, to communicate with you, to

                <h2>3. How we protect your information</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access,
                    disclosure, and misuse. We use industry-standard security technologies and procedures to protect
                    your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100%
                    secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>
                <h2>4. How we share your information</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">We may share your personal information with third-party service providers who perform services on our
                    behalf, such as payment processing, data analysis, and customer service. We may also share your
                    information with our affiliates and partners for marketing purposes. We do not sell your personal
                    information to third parties.</p>
